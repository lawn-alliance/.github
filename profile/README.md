## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the LAWN Alliance github!

Our public repos attempt to be as open to everyone as possible.
As they are generally built to solve problems for our alliance, we may decline to spend time on features we will not use. However you are always free to contribute via a merge request.

Repos beginning with `lawn-` are specifically designed for the alliance and may have abnormal requirements. We recommend using them as a base for your own app. Assistance with these will be limited.

Repos beginning with `aa-`, `allianceauth-` or anything referencing allianceauth are designed for anyone to use. Support for these will absolutely be offered.
